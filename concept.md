# Concept

A federated and curated set of lists of repositories containing public code from around the world

# What problem does this solve?

1. 'Discoverability' of Public Code - find out what has been written, who made it and how to get it
2. Repo owners manage the description via their normal code repo
3. A visitor can discover mature software rather than trawling through thousands of repositories, 

# Who is behind it?

This is an OpenUK initiative in association with the EU Free Software Policy group to provide a practical tool to support the PMPC campaign.

# Operations

Repositories seem to belong to the following categories, therefore each should have a separate index:

- Local administration
- Central government / national
- Healthcare
- Education
- Defence

A repo may exist in multiple categories if it happened to originate in one of these yet be relevant to more than one. A 'tag' concept

Each entry requires the following meta-data:

- Git username
- Description file
- Tag file (see categories)

The index will build the rest on the fly.

# Supporters
Various public organisations have offered support once the indexes are published. These will be listed in the Supporters page.
