# Concept

A federated and curated set of lists of repositories containing public code from around the world

# What problem does this solve?

1. 'Discoverability' of Public Code - find out what has been written, who made it and how to get it
2. Repo owners manage the description via their normal code repo
3. A visitor can discover mature software rather than trawling through thousands of repositories, 

# Who is behind it?

This is an OpenUK initiative in association with the EU Free Software Policy group to provide a practical tool to support the PMPC campaign.

# Operations
A repo needs to be registered in the database and have meta data within the repo to be included. The index will build the rest on the fly.
The full details of the database can be found in the database folder and here is a summary.

## Sector categories
Repositories of public code belong to a set of categories, therefore each have a separate index. For example, these may indicate:

- Local administration
- Central government / national
- Healthcare
- Education
- Defence

A repo may exist in multiple categories if it happened to originate in one of these yet be relevant to more than one.
A tag is used to indicate the categories that an entry belongs to.

## Maintainer category
Code is created and maintained by various organisations, either public, NGO or commercial.
