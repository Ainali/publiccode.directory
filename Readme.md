# publiccode.directory

After seeking contributions to an OpenUK NHS report project, it became apparent that there is lots of Public Administration Open Source being created but no curated list of applications, meaning that lots of local builds are taking place.

This project aims to enable a single directory segmented in to categories, then indexes of Public code and projects.
